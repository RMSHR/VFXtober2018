This year, i'll try an everyday in october about VFX. I'll mainly do loop videos with tunnels, abstract shapes and simple shaders.
My goal is to practice creative dev and motion design with Unity and Amplify Shader.

The project use theses library wich are not included :
- Amplifyshader (optional)
- PostProcessing Stack (the one in asset store)
- Recorder

I'll also use plugins by Keijiro :
- MidiJack
- OscJack
- Reaktion
